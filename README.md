Title: Area to Price Prediction using Linear Regression Model

Description: This is a simple data science project that utilizes a linear regression model to predict the price of a property based on its area. The project has been implemented using Python programming language, and the data has been extracted from a CSV file.

The project begins by importing necessary libraries, including pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn, which contains the linear regression model. The data is then loaded into a pandas DataFrame and preprocessed, including handling of missing values and outliers.

Next, the data is split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the linear regression model. The model is fitted on the training set using the fit() method of the linear regression object, and predictions are made on the testing set using the predict() method.

The predictions are then plotted on a scatter plot with the actual prices to visualize the accuracy of the model. The scatter plot is generated using the scatter() method of the matplotlib library. Additionally, a line plot is plotted using the plot() method of the same library to show the trend of the predictions.

Finally, the model is saved as a .pkl file using the joblib.dump() method of the joblib library, and the code is uploaded to a Github repository.

Overall, this project demonstrates the use of a simple linear regression model for price prediction and can be extended to include more complex models and features.
